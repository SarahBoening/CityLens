## MIS Project, Summerterm 2018
***

CityLens is a new way to find your way around the city. It offers three different map layers as magnifying lenses: a simple map, a cycle map and a public transport map.
The lenses are slightly transparent to blend with the context for searching and finding your desired target more easily.
This research project is inspired by:
Pietriga, Emmanuel, and Caroline Appert. "Sigma lenses: focus-context transitions combining space, time and translucence." Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM, 2008.
